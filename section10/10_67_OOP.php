<!-- OOP = Object Oriented Programming -->

<!-- Class defines 2 things: Properties[variables, arrays, any type of data], Methods[functions and behaviours] -->

<!-- So essentially a Class describes an Object -->

<!-- An Object can be: a variable, a function, a data structure -->


eg: a property of a Car

<!-- Properties -->
Wheels
Seats
Radio

<!-- Methods -->
Move wheels
Move seats
Turn on radio

<!-- Achieves more complex functionalities with less complex code -->
<!-- less chance to affect other parts of the code -->
